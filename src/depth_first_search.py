class DepthFirstSearch:
    """The DepthFirstSearch class represents a data type for determining the
    vertices connected to a given source vertex s in an undirected graph. For
    versions that find the paths, see DepthFirstPaths and BreadthFirstPaths.

    This implementation uses depth-first search. The constructor takes
    time proportional to V + E (in the worst case), where V is the
    number of vertices and E is the number of edges. It uses extra space
    (not including the graph) proportional to V.
